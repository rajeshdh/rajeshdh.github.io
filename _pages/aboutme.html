<p>Hi, My name is Rajesh Dhiman and I am a web developer. It's been 4+ year since I started my journey in this craft, started from an ignorant know-it-all novice to someone who has accepted that mastering software is implausible, but I'm still trying.
</p>
<p>
I believe skills can be taught—personality is inherent. My personality is what separates me from others. Rather than getting awards, advancing status, or gaining accolades, I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
I work with clients who want results and invest in their business in order to make it profitable. The value of what I do is based on the impact I can have on my client’s business.
</p>
<p>
I've worked with .Net stack (C#, MVC), javaScript(Node js, Angularjs, MEAN stack ), SQL and NoSql databases ( MS SQL Server, MongoDB ).
</p>
<p>
After working with .Net stack in an MNC for three years, I moved out to hills with a startup idea in mind. But unfortunately I got no success. But during this awesome journey I got my hands on various technologies other than .Net. Got to know what my weakness and strengths.

This whole journey however gave a new shape to my carrier, I became confident enough to build products, work with or without teams and time constraints.
